# YouMassD Chat App

This is a chat application built using ReactJS that serves as a project for our course. The app uses ReactJS and Socket.IO to communicate with a corresponding REST API server that was specifically built for this project. It is designed for educational purposes and showcases the utilization of modern web technologies for creating practical web applications.

Please note that the tone and theme of this app is intended to be a satirical parody of our university, and any spelling mistakes or humorous references are made in good fun. We want to make it clear that this app is not an official website of the university, and any similarities are purely coincidental. We deliberately included spelling mistakes and inconsistencies to avoid confusion and ensure that the app is not mistaken for an official school website.

We are grateful for the opportunity to learn about and apply modern web technologies like ReactJs, Socket.Io, and RestAPIs in this course. It was a fun project. We hope other also enjoyed using it as we enjoyed creating it.
